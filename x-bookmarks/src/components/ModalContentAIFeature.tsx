      Twillot 2.0 is planned to release on January 30, 2025. At that time, all 1.0 users will be able to migrate to version 2.0 automatically for free.

      <p  class="flex items-center gap-2">While Twillot 1.0 only includes bookmark management features, Twillot 2.0 is much more powerful in functionality, capable of managing almost all Twitter personal data, including bookmarks / folders / likes / posts / replies / following / blocked and other modules. </p>
